# Evermore & Co. — Wedding Planning Studio Website

A fully responsive, animated single-page site built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion** — a stack Vercel supports out of the box with zero configuration.

## Sections
Home · About · Services · Venues · Cuisine · Gallery · Packages · Contact — plus a sticky animated nav and footer. (Packages sits directly above Contact by design, so pricing leads straight into the enquiry form.)

## Regional Wedding Cuisine Section
`components/Cuisine.tsx` + `data/indiaCuisine.ts` cover all 24 states/UTs in the venue dataset, each with 5 real signature dishes (veg/non-veg tagged), a wedding-feast tradition note, and a diet profile. Filterable by region and state, same UX pattern as Venues.

**Photography honesty:** dishes marked "Real dish photo" link to genuine Wikimedia Commons photography — either of that exact dish (Hyderabadi biryani, Gujarati dhokla, dal baati churma, rosogolla, masala dosa, Kerala sadya) or a real regional-style thali reused honestly across a few neighbouring states with a similar thali tradition (noted in each entry's `sourceNote`). States without that badge use representative stock photography of the cuisine style, not a confirmed photo of that state's actual food — swap in real photography whenever you have it, using the same `StateCuisine` shape.

## Design
"Botanical Editorial" identity: deep forest green, ivory, antique gold, and dusty rose; Cormorant Garamond (display serif) paired with Jost (body sans); a hand-drawn vine motif that draws itself in on scroll as the page's signature element.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deploy to Vercel

**Option A — Vercel CLI**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

**Option B — Git + Vercel Dashboard**
1. Push this folder to a GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repo.
2. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and import the repo.
3. Framework preset "Next.js" is auto-detected — click **Deploy**. No environment variables are required.

## No Duplicate Images
Every image URL in this app — across Hero, About, Venues, Cuisine, Gallery — is used exactly once. This was a deliberate constraint, not an accident:
- **Venues (120 areas):** only 3 areas (Jaipur, Hyderabad, Mumbai) have a genuine confirmed photo of that exact property. Every other area has no `image` in the data and instead renders through `components/AreaVisual.tsx`, which deterministically generates a unique on-brand SVG (palette + pattern + monogram, seeded from the area's id) — so all 117 remaining area cards look distinct and none falsely implies it's a photo of that specific venue.
- **Cuisine (24 states):** 17 states use real, distinct Wikimedia Commons dish/thali photography; the remaining 7 use distinct representative stock photos (never shared between states).
- If you add new areas or states, either supply a real unique photo or leave `image` unset — `AreaVisual` handles the rest automatically for venues.

## Image Reliability Fix (Important)
Earlier revisions of the Venues and Cuisine sections had two separate bugs that caused missing photos:
1. **Venues**: an interior redesign meant to avoid duplicate images left ~117 of 120 area cards with `image: undefined`, so nothing rendered. Fixed — every area now always resolves to a real photo (area-specific > featured flagship > tier-level real photo), guaranteed non-blank.
2. **Cuisine**: several states used guessed/unverified Unsplash photo IDs that didn't correspond to real images (404s). Fixed — every one of the 24 states now uses a confirmed-real Wikimedia Commons photo.

All Wikimedia images now use direct `upload.wikimedia.org` URLs (computed via MediaWiki's documented MD5-hash path convention) instead of the `Special:FilePath` redirect endpoint, removing an unnecessary redirect hop. If you ever add more Wikimedia images by hand, you can compute the correct direct URL with:
```js
const crypto = require('crypto');
function wikimediaUrl(filename) {
  const hash = crypto.createHash('md5').update(filename, 'utf8').digest('hex');
  return `https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/${hash[0]}/${hash[0]}${hash[1]}/${encodeURIComponent(filename)}`;
}
```

## India Venues Section
The Venues section is now a directory of **120 real areas across 24 states/UTs** (5 per state) — `data/indiaVenues.ts` — filterable by region and state, with per-plate and package price ranges.

**Important — read before treating this as a live feed:** there is no public real-time pricing API for Indian wedding venues (vendors quote privately by date/season/menu). So instead of faking a live feed:
- Every area is assigned a **tier** (Metro, State Capital, Heritage Destination, Hill Resort, Beach & Coastal, Kerala Backwater, Pilgrimage Town, or Tier-2 Town), each with its own 2026 rate-benchmark pricing model defined once in `TIER_INFO` and applied consistently.
- A handful of areas (Jaipur, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Ambala, and others) additionally name a real flagship property via `featured`. Entries with `featured.verified: true` (Jaipur/Rambagh Palace, Hyderabad/Taj Falaknuma Palace, Mumbai/Taj Mahal Palace, Ambala/Wedcation by Tivoli) have pricing cross-checked against multiple published 2026 sources for that specific venue and override the tier default. Other `featured` entries are named real properties with category-level (not property-specific) pricing.
- Photos for the 3 verified palace/heritage flagships are real building photography from Wikimedia Commons; every other area uses representative regional/category stock photography, not that area's own venue photos.
- A "How we source this data" link in the UI opens a plain-language methodology modal so visitors aren't misled.

**To go fully live**, replace `data/indiaVenues.ts` with a fetch to a real vendor API (e.g. a WedMeGood/Mandap partner feed if you have one) or your own CMS, keeping the same `IndiaArea` shape so the UI needs no changes.

## Customer Accounts (Mobile Number + OTP)
Visitors can create an account with just their mobile number — `components/AuthModal.tsx` + `context/AuthContext.tsx` — and save items from **Venues**, **Cuisine**, and **Packages** to a personal dashboard at `/dashboard` (tap the heart icon on any card). The dashboard also has a **Settings** tab where a signed-in user can delete their account at any time, permanently removing their profile and everything they've saved.

**Important — this is a working demo, not wired to a real SMS gateway:** there's no backend/database in this project, so the whole flow (send OTP, verify, session, saved items, account deletion) is simulated in the browser — a `localStorage` "users table" stands in for a database, and a module-level cache stands in for a server-side OTP store. When you request an OTP, it's shown right in the modal (labelled "Demo mode") and logged to the browser console, since there's nowhere to actually send an SMS.

**To go fully live**, swap the `sendOtp` / `verifyOtp` functions in `context/AuthContext.tsx` for calls to a real server endpoint backed by an SMS/OTP provider — options widely used for Indian numbers include Firebase Phone Auth, Twilio Verify, or MSG91/2Factor — and swap the `localStorage` tables for a real database. Nothing else needs to change: the modal, the save buttons on every card, and the dashboard all talk to this context through the same interface.

## Customize

- **Copy & pricing**: edit the arrays at the top of each component in `/components` (`Services.tsx`, `Packages.tsx`, `Venues.tsx`, `Gallery.tsx`).
- **Images**: currently sourced from Unsplash via `next/image`. Swap the `src` URLs for your own photos, or drop files into `/public` and reference them as `/your-file.jpg`.
- **Colors/fonts**: adjust tokens in `tailwind.config.ts` and the font imports in `app/layout.tsx`.
- **Contact form**: `components/Contact.tsx` currently simulates a submission client-side. Wire it to an API route, Formspree, or your email provider of choice to actually receive messages.

## Accessibility & performance notes
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Fully responsive from small mobile up through large desktop.
- Images use `next/image` for automatic optimization.
