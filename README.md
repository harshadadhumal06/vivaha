# vivahaa — Premium Wedding Planner (India) 🪔

A modern, luxury-themed, fully responsive wedding-planning web app for Indian
weddings — built in plain **HTML5, CSS3 and ES6+ JavaScript** with no
framework, no build step, and no backend required to try it out.

Bilingual by design: every label, button, form and message switches between
**English** and **Hindi** instantly, no page reload.

---

## ✨ Features

- **12 pages**: Home, About, Services, Packages, Venues, Vendors, Gallery,
  Contact, Login, Register, Dashboard, and a 10‑step **Plan My Wedding**
  wizard.
- **Bilingual UI** (English / Hindi) via `locales/en.json` & `locales/hi.json`,
  swapped live with a `data-i18n` attribute system — no reload, no framework.
- **Live budget calculator** — the planner wizard totals your estimated
  wedding cost in real time as you pick venue, food, decor, music,
  photography, bridal services, invitations and guest count.
- **Customer dashboard** — Overview, Profile, Saved Plans, Bookings,
  Wishlist, Budget Summary, Notifications, Settings.
- **Search & filter** on Venues (city / type / capacity / keyword) and
  Vendors (category tabs / city / keyword).
- **Wishlist** (heart icon) that works across venues, vendors and the
  dashboard, persisted in `localStorage`.
- **Light / dark mode**, persisted and respecting the OS preference on first
  visit.
- **Glassmorphism** search card & testimonials, soft shadows, rounded
  corners, scroll-reveal animations, a signature "toran" (marigold-garland)
  divider motif between sections.
- **Form validation** (contact, login, register, planner) with inline error
  messages, and **toast notifications** for every action.
- **Demo authentication** — register/login backed by `localStorage` so the
  whole flow works with zero backend. See [Demo login](#demo-login) below.

## 🧱 Tech stack

Plain HTML5 / CSS3 (Flexbox + Grid) / modern JavaScript (ES6+). No React, no
build tooling, no bundler. Icons via Font Awesome (CDN), fonts via Google
Fonts (CDN) — both loaded at runtime by the browser, not part of the
repository.

Icons use the Font Awesome CDN rather than a local icon set, and the brand
mark is an inline SVG in `js/main.js` — so there's no separate `/icons`
folder to maintain.

## 🖼️ About the imagery

Every "photo" slot in this build (hero banners, venue/vendor cards, gallery,
decoration styles) is a **hand-built inline SVG illustration** — a mandap
arch, a palace silhouette, a camera and film reel, a henna-patterned hand,
and so on — rather than a hot-linked stock photo. That was a deliberate
choice, not a placeholder-in-progress:

- **It's guaranteed to render.** There's no external image host to go
  down, get rate-limited, or 404.
- **It's fast.** Each illustration is a few hundred bytes of inline SVG —
  no image requests at all.
- **It's on-brand.** Every scene uses the same ivory/gold ink so it reads
  consistently across all four card-background gradients.

All 19 scenes live in `js/illustrations.js` (`Illustrations.get(key)`),
layered on top of the `.ph` gradient backgrounds defined in `css/main.css`.
Venue types, vendor categories, decoration styles and gallery categories
each map to one of the 19 keys (see the small mapping objects at the top of
`js/home.js`, `js/listings.js`, `js/gallery.js` and `js/dashboard.js`).

**To swap in real photography instead:** replace the `<div class="ph ...">`
markup with an `<img>` (or a `background-image`) wherever `Illustrations.get(...)`
is called, or point `.ph-illustration` at your own photo CDN. Search
`Illustrations.get(` across the `js/` folder to find every call site.

## 🚀 Running locally

Translations are loaded with `fetch()`, which browsers block on the
`file://` protocol — so **serve the folder over HTTP**, don't just double-click
`index.html`. Any static server works:

```bash
# Option A — no install
npx serve -l 5000 .

# Option B — Python (already on most machines)
python3 -m http.server 5000

# Option C — via the included npm script
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000`.

## 🔑 Demo login

A demo account is auto-seeded on first load so you can try the dashboard
immediately:

```
Email:    demo@vivahaa.in
Password: demo1234
```

Registering a new account works too — everything is stored in your browser's
`localStorage`. This is **a demo auth layer only** (see
[Going to production](#going-to-production)).

## ☁️ Deploying to Vercel

1. Push this folder to a GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repo (or use the Vercel CLI
   directly).
2. In Vercel: **Add New → Project → Import** your repo.
3. Framework preset: **Other** (it's a static site — no build command, no
   output directory override needed).
4. Deploy. That's it — `vercel.json` only adds long-lived cache headers for
   `/css`, `/js`, `/assets` and a shorter one for `/locales`.

Or from the CLI, inside this folder:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

## 🎨 Customising

- **Colours, type scale, spacing, shadows** — all in `css/variables.css` as
  CSS custom properties. Change `--color-maroon` / `--color-gold` /
  `--color-emerald` to re-theme the whole site.
- **Copy & translations** — edit `locales/en.json` and `locales/hi.json`.
  Keep the two files' key structure identical (there's a small Node/Python
  snippet in the project history you can reuse to diff the keys if you add
  more).
- **Sample data** — venues, vendors, packages pricing, testimonials and
  gallery items all live in `js/data.js`.
- **Budget model** — `vivahaaData.plannerCosts` in `js/data.js` drives the
  live budget calculator on the planner page.
- **Adding a third language** — duplicate `locales/en.json` to e.g.
  `locales/mr.json`, translate the values, add a button to the `.lang-switch`
  markup in `js/main.js`, and add `"mr"` to `SUPPORTED` in `js/i18n.js`.

## 🔒 Going to production

This is a front-end demo with no server. Before shipping it for real
customers, you'll want to:

- Replace `js/auth.js` with real authentication (an API, Auth0, Firebase
  Auth, etc.) — the current version stores accounts in `localStorage` and is
  **not secure**.
- Replace `js/data.js` with calls to a real API/database for venues, vendors,
  bookings and plans.
- Add a real payments integration for the booking flow.
- Swap the placeholder image tiles for real photography (see above).

## ♿ Accessibility notes

Skip-to-content link, visible focus states, `aria-label`s on icon-only
buttons, form labels associated via `for`/`id`, and a
`prefers-reduced-motion` override that disables animation for people who ask
the OS for it.

## 🌐 Browser support

Built on evergreen web standards (CSS Grid/Flexbox, `fetch`, ES6 classes/
arrow functions, `IntersectionObserver`). Tested against current Chrome,
Edge, Firefox and Safari. No IE11 support.
